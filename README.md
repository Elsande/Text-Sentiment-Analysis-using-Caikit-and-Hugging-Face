# Overview

## Text Sentiment Analysis using Caikit and Hugging Face
This project will learn to build a Python application that uses the Caikit run-time and API to query the Hugging Face model for sentiment analysis on text strings. [Caikit](https://github.com/caikit/caikit) is an open source AI toolkit that enables users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. It provides a consistent format for creating and using AI models against a wide variety of data domains and tasks. Caikit streamlines the management of AI models for application usage which enables developers to write applications that consume AI models who may not understand the intricate details of the AI models that they use.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to load an open source AI model by using the Caikit runtime and then infer it from a client application by using the provided API. The example model is [Hugging Face DistilBERT base uncased finetuned SST-2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english), which analyzes text for sentiment.

Note: This project is based on the Caikit Tutorial: [Inferring an AI model from a client application with Caikit](https://caikit.github.io/website/docs/tutorial_appdev.html).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab you will know how to:
* Install Caikit runtime and required libraries
* Create a Python client application that calls a Hugging Face sentiment analysis model
* Invoke the sentiment analysis model with example text strings and review the output

## Prerequisites

* Linux/MacOS x86_64 [Skills Network Lab environment provides this]
* Caikit (v0.9.2) [We will install this]
* Python (v3.8+) [Skills Network Lab environment has python3.8 pre-installed]
* pip (v23.0+) [As first task in the project we will upgrade pip to latest]

## Procedure

Complete the following tasks to configure the Caikit runtime and the AI model, and then test them from a client application:
* Create the project
* Create the data model specification
* Create the model wrapper
* Include the module and package dependencies
* Start the Caikit runtime
* Test the sentiment analysis
